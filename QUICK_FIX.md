   ```
5. Click **Save**

### 2. Redeploy Frontend

2. Click **Redeploy** button
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

### 3. Upload Updated Files to GitHub

Upload these to your GitHub repository.

### 4. Test After Redeployment
After Vercel finishes redeploying:
1. Visit: https://geine-support-git-main-viplav-kumars-projects.vercel.app/
